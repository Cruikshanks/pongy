This was originally written to introduce myself to DirectX using C++. It is very basic, being a simple Pong clone, and is called 'Pongy' in reference to the standard of the code!

 which is not exactly the best example of my work, and of which I'm still trying to figure out what half of it means. But it works, doesn't seem to crash (to often), and is a game written in C++ using DirectX. That must be worth something mustn't it?
